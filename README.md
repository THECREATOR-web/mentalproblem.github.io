# MindGarden — playful mental-wellness demo

This is a single-page playful site with:
- Mood check-in (range + short journal saved to localStorage)
- Breathing exercise (guided 4‑4‑4)
- Topic cards with light, supportive descriptions (now includes Panic attack, Heart attack, Epilepsy, PTSD, etc.)
- Resources modal with external links and crisis guidance
- Dark/light theme toggle (text automatically becomes white in dark mode and black in light mode)

Important: This site is for supportive, educational, or demo use only. It is not medical advice. If you are in immediate danger call your local emergency number. In the U.S., dial or text 988 for crisis services.

How to use
1. Add or replace the files (index.html, styles.css, script.js) in the repository root: THECREATOR-web/mentalproblem.github.io
2. Commit & push.
3. Deploy with GitHub Pages:
   - For a repository named `username.github.io`, GitHub Pages should serve automatically from the `main` (or `master`) branch root.
   - Alternatively, go to the repository Settings -> Pages and set the source to the branch root.
4. Open your site at: `https://THECREATOR-web.github.io/mentalproblem.github.io/` (or the URL GitHub shows in Pages settings).

Notes on content added
- Panic attack card: outlines common symptoms and calming steps.
- Heart attack card: lists common symptoms and emphasizes calling emergency services immediately.
- Epilepsy/seizure card: gives common signs and first-aid steps, and when to call emergency services.

If you'd like, I can:
- Commit these files directly to your repository in a new branch and open a pull request (tell me which branch name you'd like), or
- Walk you through the commit & deploy steps in your environment.

Stay safe and let me know how you'd like to proceed.
